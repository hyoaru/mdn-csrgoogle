# Thinking about analytical thinking
* People don't often think about thinking.
	* Thinking is second nature to us, it just happens automatically, but there are actually many ways to think.
		* Some people think creatively
		* Some think critically
		* And some people think in abstract ways
* **Analytical thinking**
	* Identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

### Five key aspects to analytical thinking
* **Visualization**
	* Graphical representation of information.
	* Examples include graphs, maps, and other design elements.
	* Visualization is important because visuals can help data analyst understand and explain information more effectively.
* **Strategy**
	* With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused on track.
	* Strategizing helps data analyst see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
	* Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect.
	* By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us achieve our goals.
* **Problem-orientation**
	* Data analyst use a problem-oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems.
	* All about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
* **Correlation**
	* Being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data.
	* Correlation is like a relationship.
		* You can find all kinds of correlations in data.
	* As you start identifying correlations in data, there's always one thing to keep in mind:
		* Correlation does not equal causation.
			* Just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.
* **Big-picture and detailed-oriented thinking**
	* Being able to see the big picture as well as the details.
	* Big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle.
		* You can enjoy the whole picture without getting stuck on every tiny piece that went into making it.
		* If you only focus on the individual pieces, you wouldn't be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important.
		* It let's you zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities.
			* This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations.
	* On the flip side, detailed-oriented thinking is figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan.
		* In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle.

## Questions data analysts ask on the hunt for a solution
* **What is the root cause of the problem?**
	* **Root cause**
		* Reason why problem occurs.
	* If we can identify and and get rid of the cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again.
	* A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called Five Whys.
		* Ask "why?" five times to reveal the root cause.
		* The fifth and final answer should give some useful and sometimes surprising insights.
* **Where are the gaps in our process**
	* For this, many people use something called gap analysis.
	* **Gap analysis**
		* A method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future.
		* Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient.
	* The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be.
		* Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.
* **What did we not consider before?**
	* This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward.
	* These are just a few examples of the kinds of
