# Understanding the data ecosystem
* Ecosystem
	* Group of elements that interact with one another.
* Data ecosystem
	* The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
	* Includes software and hardware tools and the people who use them. 
* Cloud
	* A place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive.
	* Plays a big part in the data ecosystem.
* **Example:**
	* Tapping into retail store's database which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews.

		* This could be used to predict what customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products and stock when they are needed.

## Data scientist vs data analyst
* Data science
	* Defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
* Data scientist create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

## Data analytics vs data analysis
* Data analysis
	* Collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
* Data analytics
	* Science of data.
	* Encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

## Data-driven decision making
* One of the most powerful ways you can put data to work.
* Using facts to guide business strategy.
* Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better data-driven decisions by data analysts all the time.
* The first step in data-driven decision making is figuring out business need.
	* Usually the problem that needs to be solved
		* Whatever the problem is, once it's defined, the data analyst finds data, analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
* By ensuring that data is built into every business strategy, data analysts play a critical role in their companies' success.
	* But it's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes, even intuition.
	* To get the most out of data-driven decision making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem.
		* These people are called subject matter experts, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.
* Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. 
	* **Ask** questions and define the problem.
	* **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
	* **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
	* **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
	* **Share** data with your audience.
	* **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

## Data and gut instinct
* **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.
* **Why gut instict can be a problem**
	* At the heart of data-driven decision making is data. Therefore, it's essential that data analysts focus on the data to ensure they make informed decisions. If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased. But even worse, decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.

### Data + business knowledge = mystery solved
* Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

## Origins of data analysis process
* Data analysis is rooted in statistics, which has a pretty long history itself. 
	* Archaeologists mark the start of statistics in ancient Egypt with the building of the pyramids. 
	* The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. 
* Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes, who helped create a more technical and efficient process.

### Data analysis life cycle
* The process of going from data to decision.
* Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused.
* With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. 
* While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure of those phases. 
* There might not be one single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process.
	* **Ask**: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
	* **Prepare**: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
	* **Process**: Data cleaning/data integrity
	* **Analyze**: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
	* **Share**: Communicating and interpreting results 
	* **Act**:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem
