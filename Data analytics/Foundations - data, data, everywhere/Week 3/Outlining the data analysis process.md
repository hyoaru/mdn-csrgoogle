# Outlining the data analysis process
* **Six phases of data analysis**
	* ![](Resources/How%20the%20data%20analysis%20guides%20the%20program.png)
	* **Ask**
		* Defining the problem means looking at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state.
		* Defining the problem to be solved and making sure that we fully understand stakeholder's expectations.
			* **Stakeholders hold a stake in the project.**
				* People who invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.
				* One important step in this is determining who the stakeholders are.
					* There can be lots of stake holders and what they all have in common is they help to make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet.
				* Stakeholders care about the project and that's why it's important to understand their expectations.
					* For instance if your manager assigns you a data analysis project related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm whether they want to include all types of risk that could affect a company or just risk related to weather.
		* Types of questions are generally:
			* **What is the problem that we are trying to solve?**
			* **What is the purpose of this analysis?**
			* **What are we hoping to learn from it?**
	* **Prepare**
		* Where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process.
		* We need to be thinking about what type of data we need to answer those key questions and can be anything from quantitative, qualitative, cross-sectional or points in time versus longitudinal over a long period of time.
		* Any decisions made from your analysis should always be based on facts, be fair, and impartial.
	* **Process**
		* Find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.
			* This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete, and removing outliers.
		* All about getting the details right which means that you'll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing, and accuracte data.
	* **Analyze**
		* Involves using tools to transform and organize information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
		* Over time, as we become better and better at our jobs, what we'll often find is that we can start to intuit what we might see in the data.
			* We might have the sneaking suspicion as to what the data is trying to tell us.
			* **This is the point where we have to take a step back and let the data speak for itself.**
		* **As data analysts, we are story tellers but we also have to keep in mind that it is not our story to tell, that story belongs to the data and it is our job as analysts to amplify and tell that story in as unbiased and objective way as possible.**
	* **Share**
		* Learning how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions.
		* In this phase, visualization is the data analyst's best friend.
			* Visualization is essential to getting others to understand what your data is telling you.
			* With the right visuals, facts and figures become so much easier to see and complex concepts become easier to understand.
		* Typically, we start by sharing the high-level findings with our executive team.
			* We want them to have a landscape view of how the organization is feeling and we want to make sure that there aren't any surprises as they dig deeper and deeper into the data to understand how teams are feeling and how individual employees are feeling.
	* **Act**
		* All of these work from asking the right questions, to collecting your data, to analyzing, and sharing, doesn't mean much of anything if we aren't taking any action on what we've just learned.
		* Business takes all of the insights the data analyst have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem.
